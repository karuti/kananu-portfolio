## The Challenge
FieldPro's CRM was functioning as a basic customer database, 
but field sales managers were struggling to prioritize their daily 
activities and build meaningful customer relationships. 
Despite having access to customer data, managers were spending time on 
administrative tasks rather than strategic actions that drive business growth.

## Key Problems Identified:

- No clear guidance on which customers to prioritize each day
- Dense information presentation without strategic context
- Administrative-focused workflows instead of relationship-building actions
- Missing indicators of customer health and opportunity potential
- No actionable insights for growing customer value

## Research & Discovery

**User Interview Insights**

Through comprehensive user interviews with field sales managers, I uncovered critical pain points in their daily workflow:

- Managers spent 40+ minutes each morning trying to identify which customers needed attention
- Critical customer signals (declining orders, overdue visits) were buried in data tables
- No systematic way to assess relationship health or opportunity potential
- Lack of strategic guidance on how to grow individual customer accounts

**Behavioral Analysis Through User Journey Mapping**

I conducted a detailed behavioral analysis of the existing user journey, identifying structural barriers, psychological barriers, and missed opportunities at each step:

**Structural Barriers:**

- Static directory view with no personalization
- Manual territory analysis required
- Basic sales data without trend visualization
- No automated visit tracking or gap identification

**Psychological Barriers:**

- Information overload from dense customer lists
- Cognitive burden of manual territory analysis
- Recency bias in sales performance reviews

## Opportunities:

- Dynamic customer dashboard potential
- Visual sales trends and automated visit tracking
- AI-powered opportunity scoring and strategic action planning

**Validation Through In-App Surveys**

Using Sprig, I deployed targeted surveys to validate assumptions about user needs:

Survey 1: "What information would immediately help you prioritize your day?"

67% wanted "Days since last visit" counter
45% requested "Customer risk level" indicators

Survey 2: "What's typically the first action you take after viewing your customer list?"

73% look for customers who haven't been visited recently
52% search for specific follow-up customers

## Solution Design
Based on research insights, I designed three core interventions using behavioral design principles:

1. **Priority Customer Dashboard**
![Next best action](/images/projects/project-01/next-best-action.png)

**Behavioral Principle:**

Attention direction through visual hierarchy

- Prominently featured "Priority Customers Today" section
- Color-coded alerts for at-risk accounts (red for overdue visits, yellow for declining orders)
- Clear next-best-action buttons (Call, Schedule Visit, Send Quote)

2. **Customer Health Scoring**

**Behavioral Principle:** 

Loss aversion and social proof

- Visual relationship strength indicators (Developing, Strong, Established)
- Customer value metrics prominently displayed
- Competitive threat alerts and opportunity signals

3. **Strategic Insights Panel**

**Behavioral Principle:** 

Cognitive ease through actionable recommendations

- "Product Mix Opportunity" suggestions based on order history
- "Similar Customer Success" patterns with specific strategies
- "Seasonal Opportunity" alerts with preparation recommendations

## Testing & Validation

**Prototype Testing**

I created interactive prototypes and tested them with 12 field sales managers:

- Task completion improved by 60% when identifying priority customers
- Decision-making time reduced by 45% for daily planning
- User satisfaction scores increased from 6.2 to 8.7 out of 10

**Assumption Validation**

Follow-up Sprig surveys confirmed key design decisions:

- 89% found priority customer highlighting "extremely helpful"
- 82% said customer health indicators "would change how I plan my day"
- 76% wanted to see strategic insights on customer pages

## Implementation & Results

**Sprint Planning & Development**

I translated research insights into actionable development tickets:

- Created detailed user stories with behavioral success criteria
- Defined metrics for measuring relationship-building vs. administrative actions
- Established A/B testing framework for ongoing optimization

## Measurable Impact

Post-launch analytics showed significant improvements:

**Engagement Metrics:**

- Page exploration increased by 45%
- Time spent on customer profiles increased by 67%
- Daily active feature usage up 35%

**Behavioral Shifts:**

- Bounce rate decreased by 38%
- Relationship-building actions increased by 61%
- Customer visit frequency improved by 23%

## Key Learnings


- **User research depth drives design quality**: The behavioral journey mapping revealed opportunities that surface-level interviews missed
- **Continuous validation prevents feature bloat**: In-app surveys helped prioritize the most impactful features
- **Metrics alignment ensures business impact**: Tracking relationship-building vs. administrative actions proved ROI
