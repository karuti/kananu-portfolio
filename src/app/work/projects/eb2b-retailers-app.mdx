## Overview

**Market Context:**

FieldPro already served major brands (Nestlé, Fan Milk, BIC) through field sales rep apps, 
where representatives would visit retailers (supermarkets, kiosks) to collect orders for brand delivery.

**Strategic Opportunity Identified:** 

Create direct digital connection between brands and retailers, enabling self-service 
ordering while maintaining valuable field sales relationships for strategic account management.

**Challenge:**

Bridge the gap between traditional field sales processes and modern retailer expectations for on-demand ordering, credit management, and personalized experiences.

**Solution:**

Native B2B marketplace app allowing retailers to place orders directly, access personalized recommendations, 
manage credit facilities, and earn loyalty rewards.

**Impact:**

Successfully scaled from initial concept to processing 10,000+ daily orders, 
creating new revenue channel while strengthening brand-retailer relationships.


## Product Development Journey

## Strategic Market Opportunity
**Existing Ecosystem Analysis:**

- Major FMCG brands (Nestlé, Fan Milk, BIC) relied entirely on field sales reps for order collection

- Retailers wanted more flexibility to order outside of scheduled rep visits

- Brands missed opportunities for direct relationship building with retailers

- No digital touchpoint for promotions, recommendations, or loyalty programs

**Market Gap Identified:**

While maintaining essential field sales relationships for strategic account management, retailers needed:

- On-demand ordering capability for urgent restocks

- Direct access to product catalogs and promotions

- Personalized product recommendations based on purchase history

- Credit management and payment flexibility

- Loyalty program participation and rewards tracking

**Competitive Advantage:**

Create hybrid model combining human relationship building (field sales) with digital convenience (mobile app), rather than replacing one with the other.

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept (POC)

**Objective:**

 Validate demand for direct brand-retailer digital ordering alongside existing field sales
Key Activities:

- Interviewed retailers across different segments (supermarkets, kiosks, convenience stores)

- Analyzed field sales data to identify ordering pattern gaps and missed opportunities

- Surveyed brand partners (Nestlé, Fan Milk, BIC) on appetite for direct retailer relationships

- Built minimal prototype testing core ordering and credit management flows

- Defined success metrics balancing new channel growth with field sales relationship preservation

**Critical Validation:**

- 78% of retailers expressed interest in supplemental digital ordering capability

- Brands confirmed strategic value in direct retailer data and relationship building

- Field sales teams supported concept when positioned as enhancement rather than replacement

Outcome: Secured multi-brand partnership commitment and development resources for MVP
