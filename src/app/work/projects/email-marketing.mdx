## The Challenge

Beauty Bar by Maridadi, a Kenyan beauty retailer, was struggling to maximize their digital revenue potential. 
Despite having an established customer base and quality product selection, their email marketing was severely underperforming 
and not generating consistent revenue.


The core challenge was clear: 
*How do we transform email marketing from an afterthought into a reliable revenue driver that generates consistent monthly income?*

**The Problem:**
- Email marketing contributing less than 5% of total revenue
- No automated customer journey or welcome series
- Generic messaging that didn't resonate with Kenyan beauty consumers
- Poor mobile experience in a mobile-first market
- Inconsistent branding across email touchpoints

## Strategic Diagnosis

Following a comprehensive email marketing audit, I 
began with understanding not just *what* customers needed, but *why* they 
weren't engaging with Beauty Bar's emails.

### Defining the Target Outcome

I started by precisely defining the desired business outcome:

> "Establish email marketing as a reliable revenue channel contributing 15%+ of total business revenue while building sustainable customer relationships"

**Success Specifications:**
- **Revenue Target:** KES 25,000+ monthly email revenue
- **Engagement:** 40%+ open rates (vs 21% industry average)
- **Automation:** Self-sustaining welcome series and customer journeys
- **Growth:** Measurable month-over-month revenue increase

### Market Research & Customer Analysis

I conducted detailed analysis of the Kenyan beauty market and Beauty Bar's customer behavior:

**Kenyan Beauty Market Insights:**
- **Mobile-first consumption:** 80%+ of email opens on mobile devices
- **Education-driven purchases:** Strong preference for skincare education before buying
- **Trust-building critical:** Customer testimonials and social proof essential
- **Price-quality balance:** Conscious about price but focused on results
- **Local relevance:** Messaging must address specific Kenyan skin concerns

### Identifying Revenue Barriers

Through this analysis, three critical challenges emerged:

**1. No Customer Journey Strategy**
- New subscribers received no welcome sequence
- No automated follow-up after purchase
- Missing re-engagement campaigns for dormant subscribers

**2. Generic, Non-Localized Messaging**
- Emails didn't speak to Kenyan beauty concerns
- No cultural relevance in design or copy
- Missing local currency and shipping context

**3. Poor Mobile Experience**
- Templates not optimized for mobile-first audience
- Slow loading images and poor readability
- CTAs not thumb-friendly for mobile users

## Strategic Solutions

Based on these insights, I developed a comprehensive email marketing strategy with three core pillars:

### 1. Welcome Series Automation System

To capture and convert new subscribers immediately, I designed a strategic welcome journey:

*The welcome journey that generated KES 13,040 in one month*




### 2. Culturally Relevant Campaign Strategy

To address the localization gap, I developed campaigns specifically for the Kenyan market for 
instance wishing our customers during kenyan national holidays like Madaraka Day.

**Results from this single campaign:**
- 26% open rate (vs 21% industry average)
- Direct revenue attribution of KES 8,500
