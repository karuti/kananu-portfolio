## The Challenge

FieldPro, a field sales management platform, was facing a critical user adoption problem. Despite having registered users, **only 17% were active users** — a concerning metric that threatened the platform's viability. Sales managers, the primary target audience, were struggling to make FieldPro their go-to tool for managing their field teams.

*The original FieldPro dashboard - overwhelming and disconnected*

The core challenge was clear: *How do we get sales managers to log into FieldPro every workday morning and use it as their primary platform for managing their entire field force?*

## Behavioral Diagnosis

Following the behavioral design framework, I began with a comprehensive behavioral diagnosis to understand not just *what* users needed to do, but *why* they weren't doing it.

### Defining the Target Behavior

I started by precisely defining the desired behavior:

> "Every workday morning, sales managers log into FieldPro and manage their entire field force from a single platform"

**Behavioral Specifications:**
- **Frequency:** Daily (first thing in the morning)
- **Context:** Office environment, beginning of workday, planning mode
- **Success Metric:** 75%+ of managers using platform as primary work tool

### Mapping the User Journey

I conducted a detailed analysis of the current user experience, mapping out the user journey managers needed to take:

![User Journey Map](/images/projects/project-01/Behaviour-map.png)
*The complete user journey from login to action*



### Identifying Behavioral Barriers

Through this analysis, two critical challenges emerged:

**1. Cognitive Overload and Decision Fatigue**

Sales managers were overwhelmed by disconnected data points across multiple systems. They faced:
- Decision fatigue from manual prioritization tasks
- Analysis paralysis when trying to make sense of fragmented metrics
- Mental effort required to switch between systems and synthesize information

**2. Misaligned Mental Models and Present Bias**

Managers experienced:
- Unclear connection between platform actions and business outcomes
- No immediate benefit visible from using the platform
- The classic present bias problem where short-term effort doesn't yield immediate, tangible rewards


## Design Solutions

Based on these behavioral insights, I developed three core design interventions that directly address the identified barriers:

*The three-pillar approach to solving behavioral barriers*

### 1. AI-Powered Intelligence System

To combat decision fatigue and cognitive overload, I designed an AI system that transforms raw data into actionable intelligence:

![AI Intelligence Dashboard](/images/projects/project-01/ai-powered.png)
*AI-powered insights with contextual recommendations*

**Contextual Insights with Clear Next Steps:**

- AI analyzes patterns and surfaces critical issues with specific context (e.g., "5 high-value customers have reduced order volume by 20%+ in the last 30 days. This represents a potential revenue risk of $25,000.")
- Each insight includes immediate action buttons: "View Affected Customers" and "Assign Follow-up"
- System categorizes insights by business impact: Order Intelligence, Team Management, Product Intelligence

**Smart Priority Action Queue:**

The AI eliminates decision paralysis by presenting a prioritized action list with visual urgency indicators:

![Priority Action Queue](/images/projects/project-01/priority-actions.png)
*Smart prioritization reduces decision fatigue*

- **Critical actions (red):** "Orders Pending Confirmation - 5 Orders require your approval"
- **High priority (orange):** "High-Value Customers Not Visited - 12 customers in 30+ days"
- **Medium priority (blue):** "Territory Coverage Review - Monthly review due"

This approach removes the cognitive burden of figuring out "what should I do first?" and provides clear, actionable next steps.

### 2. Contextual Metrics Dashboard

To address information avoidance and present bias, I redesigned how performance data is presented:

![Contextual Metrics](/images/projects/project-01/Contextual-metrics.png)
*Metrics with meaningful context and visual indicators*

**Metrics with Meaningful Context:**

Instead of showing raw numbers, each metric includes comparative context:

- **"38 Customer Visits"** becomes **"38 visits (17% vs target)"** with directional indicators
- **"27 Orders Confirmed"** shows **"3% below target"** with red indicator for immediate attention
- **"48 Submissions"** displays **"8% from yesterday"** with green upward arrow showing positive momentum


- Color coding (green for on-track, red for attention needed) eliminates cognitive processing time
- Comparative indicators (vs. yesterday, vs. target) provide immediate context for action

### 3. Behavioral Flow Optimization

To overcome status quo bias and build engagement habits:

![User Flow Optimization](/images/projects/project-01/priority-actions.png)
*Optimized user flows reduce friction and build engagement*

**Guided Action Pathways:**

- From any insight, users have clear "primary" and "secondary" action paths
- Each action is designed to keep users within the platform ecosystem
- Success states provide immediate positive feedback to reinforce platform usage

**Reduced Friction Design:**

![Friction Reduction](/images/projects/project-01/priority-actions.png)
*Single-click actions and contextual information reduce cognitive load*

- **Single-click actions** for common tasks (Approve Orders, Optimize Routes)
- **Contextual information** prevents need to switch between systems
- **Clear visual hierarchy** guides users through complex workflows without overwhelm

### The Design Impact

**Before Implementation:**
- Managers spent 45+ minutes each morning gathering data from multiple systems
- 83% of users abandoned tasks due to complexity
- No clear prioritization led to important issues being missed

**After Implementation:**
- **5-minute morning routine** with AI-prioritized action items
- **Single dashboard** provides complete operational oversight
- **Immediate value** visible from first interaction
- **Clear next steps** eliminate decision paralysis


### Design Principles Applied

**1. Reduce Cognitive Load**
- Chunked information presentation
- Visual hierarchy for quick scanning
- Contextual data reduces mental processing

**2. Create Immediate Value**
- Quick wins visible within first 30 seconds
- Progress indicators provide instant feedback
- AI recommendations save time immediately

**3. Guide Behavior**
- Clear primary/secondary action paths
- Visual cues direct attention to high-impact areas
- Success states reinforce positive usage patterns

## Results and Measurement


*Key metrics showing the transformation in user behavior*

The success of these interventions would be measured through specific behavioral metrics:

**Primary Measures:**
- Click-through rate on action buttons
- Number of feature pages explored per session
- Time spent on dashboard and subsequent pages
- Completion rate of suggested actions
- Return visit frequency

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Increase active user rate from **17% to 75%**
- ✅ Daily platform engagement by sales managers
- ✅ Multiple session interactions throughout the day

## The Transformation

**Before:**
- Overwhelming data dumps
- No clear priorities
- Cognitive overload from system switching
- Analysis paralysis from disconnected metrics

**After:**
- Clean, prioritized daily dashboard
- Single source of truth for all field operations
- Contextual insights that drive immediate action
- Streamlined workflows that reduce cognitive load

*The redesigned FieldPro dashboard with clear hierarchy and immediate value*

## Key Learnings

This case study reinforced several important principles about behavioral design in B2B contexts:

**1. Behavior-first thinking**
Starting with the specific behavior we wanted to drive, rather than features we wanted to build, led to more targeted solutions.

**2. Systematic barrier identification**
Using a structured framework to identify barriers prevented us from making assumptions about user resistance.

**3. Immediate vs. long-term value balance**
Even in B2B contexts, users need immediate feedback and value to sustain long-term behavioral change.

The FieldPro case demonstrates how applying behavioral science principles can transform user adoption challenges from feature problems into behavior design opportunities.
